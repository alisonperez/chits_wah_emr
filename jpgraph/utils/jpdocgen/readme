DDDA Public release 1
=====================

This directory contains all the files necessary to
run the DDDA (Database Driven Documentation Architecture).

1. Introduction.

The DDDA system lets you parse a project which may consist
of multiple PHP source file and record all classes, methods 
and global functions in a database.

When this is done you can add comments and examples which
is also stored in the database. All this is done through a
GUI provided in this application.

Whenever the source is changed you just update the DB
and the new methods and classes will be added while keeping
any old comments and description.

It will automatically calculate a percentage figure for
each class and method that indicates how well it is documented.

When you are happy with the result you can automatically
generate reference documentation from this DB.

2. Installation

You need to edit you MySQL DB server, user and pwd to match
your system in 'de_utils.php'.

The point your browser to jpdocedit.php.

3. Usage

Most should be self explaining. The first thing you must
do is to create a project and define a number of files
belonging to this project. After that you need to update
the DB by first going into the project view and then
pressing the 'Update DB' button.
